ldap2config
===========

The purpose of this script is to generate configuration files with LDAP entries.

It works using two more configuration files :
- The main configuration file : an ini form configuration containing
                                informations about the LDAP server, the file
                                which will be created, logging, etc.
                                See example.ini
- A template file : Your configuraiton template. See example.tpl

Invocation
==========

   $ python configuration.ini

Known Bugs
==========

- We cannot indicate what to do if a value is empty and we want it.
- default_values are case insensitive, but ldap entries are not, causing the
  replacement never happen
